# Sentimenta — Mood Tracker with AI Suggestions

**Sentimenta** is a web application for daily mood tracking and analysis. Users rate their mood on a scale from 1 to 5, select emotions from a list or add their own, and optionally write a short note about their day. After saving the entry, the system provides a personalized suggestion generated by AI. The interface is built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, ensuring high performance and responsive design.

## Key Features
